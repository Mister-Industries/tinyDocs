We're changing up our Devnotes to from monthly to weekly updates! The goal of this is to promote "working with the garage door open," giving (you) our followers the inside scoop on our progress and decisions. Let's get into the weeknote:

This week was crazy! For starters, we released a 2 minute teaser for the tinyCore, and it **blew up**! (at least for us). It's currently standing at just over 2k views! You can check it out here if you missed it: [https://youtu.be/wqKJGHjnWzM](https://youtu.be/wqKJGHjnWzM)

Hey guys! I'll be trying to post periodic/bi-weekly updates on development more frequently in these channels. Here's what happened in the last two weeks.
We are rapidly developing the tinyCore as the first element of our project. Revision 2 has been created, with some minor circuit modifications and bug fixes. We've ordered 20 of this board, on 1/14, and we expect the boards to arrive prior to 2/22.

I had Claude write up an I2S Test for a speaker, specifically the MAX98357A. Here's the program it wrote:

Finally got the SD Card working! Turns out the CS Pin is connected to GPIO1, not GPIO2, due to a pin mix-up in the library. Simple software fix, and it's like magic!

Also, I would recommend verifying that you don't have a corrupted Chinese-knockoff SD Card, as this will also cause you headaches and make things more difficult to solve.

For the SD test, we actually used the Arduino SD_Test Example, which worked out of the box (with our custom board library):
