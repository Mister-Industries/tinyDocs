Hey guys! I'll be trying to post periodic/bi-weekly updates on development more frequently in these channels. Here's what happened in the last two weeks.
We are rapidly developing the tinyCore as the first element of our project. Revision 2 has been created, with some minor circuit modifications and bug fixes. We've ordered 20 of this board, on 1/14, and we expect the boards to arrive prior to 2/22.
