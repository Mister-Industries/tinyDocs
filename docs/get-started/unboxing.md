## 1. What's Inside
---

Inside your tinyCore V2 Kit, you should find several things to help you get started:

- 1x Tiny Core V2
- 1x Clam-shell enclosure
- 2x M3 Screws (don't lose these!)
- 2x 8-pin Female Headers
- 1x 9-pin Male Headers
- 1x USB-C Cable
- 1x STEMMA Connector
- 1x 4GB Micro SD Card
- 1x Micro SD Card Reader
- 1x Plastic project box (the kit itself!)

## 2. Preparing the Headers (Optional) 

(As of the tinyCore V2.1 Kit, this step will not be necessary.)

Here's your first big challenge: Soldering the headers!

Luckily they are "key-ed"[^1] by number, so you can only 

[^1]: "Key-ing" is a mechanical term that describes when something is designed in a way that it will only fit one way. Think of house keys!

We have three headers to solder, Two Female, and one Male (9-pins)

The female headers look like this, and are for the left and right (Digital and Analog) pins. 

Make sure they are face up on your board, then flip over the board and solder.

The male headers look like this and are for the bottom (Serial) pins. 

After soldering in the female headers, you can place in the male header pins, and solder these too. 

## 3. Assembling the Enclosure

Once the headers are soldered, we can put the PCB in the enclosure!

First, gently open up the clamshell[^2] body of the enclosure. Unclip the hinges and open up the shell. 

[^2]: Meaning two parts that fit together

Place the PCB so that the screw holes line up with the holes in the enclosure. The solid dot goes towards the top!

Then place in and tighten the M3 Screws provided in your kit.

Do not overtighten the screws! Just make sure they are snug.

Once the PCB is fit correctly and tightened down, return the cover to it's original position, making sure that the headers align with the holes in the top.

Now your tinyCore is ready to use!
