Welcome to Weeknotes Wednesday! If you're reading this Weeknote, then you probably already know what we're gonna be talking about.. We have a new docs website! This will hold all of our new documentation and weeknotes moving forward. It's still under construction, but we will be working to rapidly fill out tutorials, datasheets, how-to's and more!

<!-- more -->

Aside from creating this entire website, we have some other updates:

- Applied to the Clear Creek Makerspace Underdogs Grant fund with MatrixOwl
- Hand-delivered a tinyCore V2 Starter Kit to a *certain* YouTuber :sunglasses:
- Presented at the 20th Anniversary event for Clear Creek Makerspace

Speaking of CCM, this Monday was their 20th Anniversary, and to celebrate, they hosted a large event, which we were invited to participate in! 

Here's some photos of our "booth" from the event. It was great to meet everyone, show off some of our student projects, and make the first irl debut of tinyCore!

Our next batch of boards have just cleared customs and are on their way now!

We also received our new plastic enclosures and they look fantastic!

More updates to come!
