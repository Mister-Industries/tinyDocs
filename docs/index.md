## About the Team:
---

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="grid-item" markdown >
Created by best friends, Geoff McIntyre and Aiden Reeves, tinyCore emerges from a shared vision to bridge the gap between academic engineering and industry practice.

As graduates from CU Boulder and Colorado School of Mines respectively, they have experienced firsthand the challenges new engineers face: entry-level positions demanding years of experience, and career-changers struggling to enter the field without clear pathways.

Together, they founded MR. INDUSTRIES *(pronounced "Mister")* guided by three core principles:

### **Integrity, Excellence, and Progress.**

By building in the open and putting humans first, [MR.INDUSTRIES](http://MR.INDUSTRIES) is making professional embedded development accessible to everyone.
