We're changing up our Devnotes to from monthly to weekly updates! The goal of this is to promote "working with the garage door open," giving (you) our followers the inside scoop on our progress and decisions. Let's get into the weeknote:

This week was crazy! For starters, we released a 2 minute teaser for the tinyCore, and it **blew up**! (at least for us). It's currently standing at just over 2k views! You can check it out here if you missed it: [https://youtu.be/wqKJGHjnWzM](https://youtu.be/wqKJGHjnWzM)

And speaking of my best friend Aiden, he posted his first YouTube video this week! And it features the tinyCore! He's designed a custom LED controller HAT, and put together a heckin' awesome cyberpunk-inspired light-up jacket. Be sure to check it out here:

As for orders, we began offering shipping in the US this week on our website, and we've started taking our next batch of pre-orders. Our current production run completed fabrication this week and is currently in assembly, with 100 units slated to arrive by April 5th!

Aside from hardware, we've also gone through and begun revising ALL of our documentation. (The main piece of feedback was that we needed **more.**)

So we've revamped the ENTIRE GitHub Repo, overhauled the README.md, reorganized our file structures, added Datasheets for all major components, and begun our first draft of the tinyCore Datasheet!

I'm particularly proud of the Pinout graphic (that took me hours to create):

By no means is this documentation finished, but we hope these updates will help you understand our kit better!

Oh, and also it's Spring Break now! So the next week should see a lot of progress, since I don't have homework.

Looking ahead, we're going to continue work on our project documentation and YouTube presence, and we will be presenting our project at a few events! Namely:

- Clear Creek Makerspace Anniversary Celebration - 3/31
- Mines Entrepreneurship Summit - 4/16
- CU Boulder Engineering Expo - 4/25
- ATLAS Expo - 5/1

**We're very excited to meet with more students and see what people build with tinyCore! Hope to see you there!**
